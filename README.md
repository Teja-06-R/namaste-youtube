# Namaste Youtube (React + Redux + Tailwind)

A YouTube-like video platform built using **React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and the YouTube Data API**.  
This project is part of my MERN fullstack learning journey, where I focus on building **real-world apps** while sharing my progress publicly.  


## 🚀 Features Implemented So Far

- ✅ **Header + Sidebar Layout** – Sidebar toggle using **Redux state**  
- ✅ **Video Feed** – Integrated with YouTube Data API to fetch & display video thumbnails  
- ✅ **Routing** – Navigation to a **Watch Page** using `createBrowserRouter`  
- ✅ **Search Suggestions** – Implemented with **debouncing** for performance  
- ✅ **Caching Search Results** – Avoids repeated API calls for same queries  
- ✅ **Nested Comments** – Demo of recursive comment structure (like Reddit)  



## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to manage **global UI state** (sidebar open/close) with Redux  
- How to use **debouncing + caching** to optimize API-heavy apps  
- Setting up **routing** with React Router v6  
- Rendering **nested recursive data structures** (comments section)  
- Using **Tailwind CSS** for quick responsive layouts  



## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 🎨 Improve overall UI/UX (better styling with Tailwind)  
- 🌗 Add **Dark Mode** toggle  
- 📜 Live Chat for video  
- ❤️ Like / Watch Later functionality  
- 🎬 Full YouTube Watch Page with recommended videos
